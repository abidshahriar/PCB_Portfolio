# PCB Design and Fabrication Portfolio (Updating, And Currently learning Hi-speed PCB Design )
This portfolio showcases my previous work in PCB design and fabrication. It includes pictures of various PCBs that I have designed and fabricated using PCB Designing tools.

## Projects
This portfolio includes pictures of the following PCBs that I have designed and fabricated:

- Home Automation PCB
- Motor driver circuit
- UWB Based Circuit Board
- ATtint Ultra Low powered 7-segment LED clock
- And more!
- Highspeed PCB Design Commming Sooonnnnnn!!!!!!!
  
## Research Article (latest inclusion: Year 2025)
Read my article where I've used Clever design practices and how I optimize the Power Density Across the Board:
